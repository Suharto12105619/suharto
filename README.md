A 1m^2 lily pad doubles in size every day. On the 20th day, it covers the entire pond.
On what day was the pond half-covered? on the 19th day, the size is 2^(19)
What is the size of the entire pond? If we assume the size of the pond on the 20th day is 1, then the size of the pond on the 19th day is 0.5. Since the lotus leaf doubles every day, then on the 20th day the pond is full to the size of 1.
How large would the pond need to be if the lily pads have to continue doubling in size for another 5 days ? If the lotus leaves continue to multiply for another 5 days, then the pond will cover 2^5 times the existing pond. So, the size of the pond needed is 2^(19) * 2^5 = 2^(24)1.
Work this out:
A + A + A = 15 : A = 15 / 3 = 5
W + B + B = 20 : W + 2B = 20
A + B + W = 21 : 5 + B + W = 21 => B + W = 16
A  + W * B = ? 53

2B = 20 - W => B = (20 - W) / 2
3: (20 - W) / 2 + W = 16
20 - W + 2W = 32
W = 12
B = (20 - 12) / 2 = 4
Jadi, A + W * B = 5 + 12 * 4 = 53
